Html5 on Rails
=====

by Daniel Morrison, Collective Idea

This plugin is a bit of a playground to see what html goodies we can do. I'm implementing things as I desire them, and not in any normal order.

Current Features
=======

Since the type attributes for CSS and javascript tags have sensible defaults, we can omit them unless we need to override them.
<script src="/javascripts/all.js"></script>
<link href="/stylesheets/main.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet">

Don't self-close tags. This allows us to have <img src="foo.png"> instead of <img src="foo.png" />. Of course you'll need that if you're serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml, but if you know what that means, you'll probably know how to override it.
